# Task

Someone in Dreadsbury Mansion killed Aunt Agatha. Agatha, the butler, and Charles live in Dreadsbury Mansion and are the only ones to live there. A killer always hates, and is no richer than his victim. Charles hates no one that Agatha hates. Agatha hates everybody except the butler. The butler hates everyone not richer than Aunt Agatha. The butler hates everyone whom Agatha hates. No one hates everyone. Who killed Agatha?

In order to add some dynamic, you can try to make two operations:

1) First operation initializes at random all variables. Here you'll practice assignments.
2) The second one attempts to pick the killer. If it is impossible, perform the first operation again.
3) If the killer is picked, then the work is done. Use invariant to check who it is.
